          <h1 class="sectionday">&nbsp;&nbsp;MOROCCO, DAY 3 (11/25/18)</h1>
          <h3 class="sectiontitles">&nbsp;&nbsp;PREFACE</h3>
            <p>Yay, I made my own website from scratch.  Sure I didn't get around to it until a year after the trip to Morocco (Morocco was in
              November 2018, and I put this together in October 2019), but better late than never.  Facebook and Instagram, eat your heart out.</br>  
              
              
              I had it all planned out.  &nbsp;Create my first website, experience Morocco, then upload the photos to my website.  &nbsp;Simple, right?  
                &nbsp;Well, my job spins me in a tornado sometimes, and before I new it, I no longer had time to finish building the site
               prior to the trip.  &nbsp;When I arrived back home, I wanted to create the content, but the thought of having to nitpick at the website
               infrastructure first no longer appealed to me.  &nbsp;On top of that, I had an issue with my photos duplicating themselves for some 
               reason, and that tornado in my life was as relentless as ever.  &nbsp;The project slipped away.
            </p>
            
            <p>Now, one year later (October 2019), I decided to finally put it all together.  &nbsp;Sure, the details of my trip to Morocco are not as fresh as they were a 
              year ago, but it was a nice trip, and I have some great pictures. &nbsp;This may be a simple website, but it's my own.
              &nbsp;Facebook and Instagram, eat your heart out.
            </p>
            <p>Now about that trip...
            </p>
